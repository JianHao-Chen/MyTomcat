/**
 * A <b>Wrapper</b> is a Container that represents an individual servlet
 * definition from the deployment descriptor of the web application.  It
 * provides a convenient mechanism to use Interceptors that see every single
 * request to the servlet represented by this definition.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of Wrapper are responsible for managing the servlet life
 * cycle for their underlying servlet class, including calling init() and
 * destroy() at appropriate times, as well as respecting the existence of
 * the SingleThreadModel declaration on the servlet class itself.
 * <p>
 * The parent Container attached to a Wrapper will generally be an
 * implementation of Context, representing the servlet context (and
 * therefore the web application) within which this servlet executes.
 * <p>
 * Child Containers are not allowed on Wrapper implementations, so the
 * <code>addChild()</code> method should throw an
 * <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.
