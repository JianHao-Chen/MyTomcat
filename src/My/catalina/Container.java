/**
 * A <b>Container</b> is an object that can execute requests received from
 * a client, and return responses based on those requests. A Container may
 * optionally support a pipeline of Valves that process the request in an
 * order configured at runtime, by implementing the <b>Pipeline</b> interface
 * as well.
 * 
 * Containers will exist at several conceptual levels within Catalina. It can be
 * Engine,Host,Context,Wrapper. But : 
 * 	A given deployment of Catalina need not include Containers at all of the
 * 	levels described above.
 * 
 *  A Container may also be associated with a number of support components
 * that provide functionality which might be shared (by attaching it to a
 * parent Container) or individually customized.  The following support
 * components are currently recognized:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Loader</b> - Class loader to use for integrating new Java classes
 *     for this Container into the JVM in which Catalina is running.
 * <li><b>Logger</b> - Implementation of the <code>log()</code> method
 *     signatures of the <code>ServletContext</code> interface.
 * <li><b>Manager</b> - Manager for the pool of Sessions associated with
 *     this Container.
 * <li><b>Realm</b> - Read-only interface to a security domain, for
 *     authenticating user identities and their corresponding roles.
 * <li><b>Resources</b> - JNDI directory context enabling access to static
 *     resources, enabling custom linkages to existing server components when
 *     Catalina is embedded in a larger server.
 * </ul>
